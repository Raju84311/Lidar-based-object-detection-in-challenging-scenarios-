# üõ∞Ô∏è LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection using KITTI Dataset

This project presents the implementation and comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art deep learning models for 3D object detection using LiDAR point cloud data. Leveraging the widely adopted **KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark**, each model is tested for accuracy and inference speed, and their outputs are visually and analytically assessed.

## üß† Models Implemented

The following five models were implemented and tested:

| Model Name     | Description                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **PV-RCNN++**  | Enhanced point-voxel feature fusion for precise 3D detection |
| **CenterPoint**| Anchor-free detection using object center estimation |
| **PointPillars**| Efficient encoding of LiDAR data as pseudo images |
| **SECOND**     | Sparsely Embedded Convolutional Detection network |
| **CIA-SSD**    | Class-balanced anchor-free single-stage detector |

Each model includes:
- Source code
- Two sample output visualizations
- Corresponding performance graphs (accuracy vs. FPS)
