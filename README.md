# üõ∞Ô∏è LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection using KITTI Dataset

This project presents the implementation and comparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art deep learning models for 3D object detection using LiDAR point cloud data. Leveraging the widely adopted **KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark**, each model is tested for accuracy and inference speed, and their outputs are visually and analytically assessed.
